 The Inventory collects 474 indicators and draws from Chapter 5 of the OECD 2020 report: The Circular Economy in Cities and Regions. The Inventory is intended to be a dynamic tool that will be updated, following the progress cities, regions and national governments are making in measuring advancements towards the circular economy.
What the Inventory is about
The OECD Inventory of Circular Economy Indicators collects 474 circular-economy-related indicators, between 2018 and 2020. Collected indicators belong to 29 circular economy studies of which 8 are applied at the national level, 8 at the regional level and 11 at the local level (Annex A). The OECD inventory
 THE OECD INVENTORY OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY INDICATORS© OECD 2021

includes indicators signalled by respondents of the OECD Survey on the Circular Economy in Cities and Regions (OECD, 2020[1]). As per the geographical scope, most of the indicators are from European sources but the inventory also includes available sources from North and South America (Canada, Chile and Colombia).
The OECD inventory gathers input, process and output indicators employed by governments at different levels, in particular to monitor and evaluate the progress of existing circular economy strategies. The inventory provides an overview of circular economy measurement frameworks. It helps identify measurement gaps and can be a source of inspiration for governments wishing to develop or use indicators to improve circular-economy-related policies.
The inventory is intended to be a dynamic tool to be frequently and regularly updated given the progress made by countries, regions and cities in developing circular economy strategies and related measurement frameworks.
The inventory classifies circular economy indicators into five main categories (Figure 1):

In order to provide a clear reading of the scope of the collected indicators, they have been classified into five main categories (economy and business; environment; governance; infrastructure and technology; and jobs), 33 sub-categories and 11 sectors (Table 1Table 1.).
Regarding the scale, the literature refers to three main scales at which measurements are carried out: micro (such as a product or company), meso (such as eco-industrial parks and industrial symbiosis) and macro (such as a city, province, region, or nation) levels (Moraga et al., 2019[6]; Ekins et al., 2019[7]; Alaerts et al., 2018[8]). The OECD Inventory of Circular Economy Indicators collects macro-level indicators.

    In addition to categories and sub-categories, indicators are categorised according to the sector to which they belong. However, when indicators do not relate to a specific sector or relate to the “circular economy” in general, they have been categorised as “not sector-specific”. Sectors with representation equal or below 1% of the OECD inventory have been included in the “Other” category. The 11 sectors are the following: air; built environment; energy; food; public administration; resources and materials; reuse, repair, share; waste; water; not sector-specific; and other (agriculture, culture, forest, industry, land use, mobility, textile and tourism).

The OECD inventory distinguishes 11 sectors. Mostly, indicators from the inventory do not refer to any specific sector (not sector-specific, 31% of the OECD inventory) but rather to the circular economy in the broadest sense of the term. Contrary to other indicators, they may be objective-driven rather than data- driven, as they have been created specifically to measure the progress of circular economy initiatives. Examples of these indicators are: the number of companies that received financial assistance related to the circular economy; and the number of city contracts evaluated using circular economy principles. The remaining sectors are the following (Figure 2):

 The waste sector represents 20% of the inventory. Mostly, indicators are related to the environment category (71%; Figure 3). Indicators concern both waste generation and management. Waste indicators also distinguish across categories of waste, such as bio-waste, plastics waste and electrical waste. Waste treatment differentiates between landfill, incinerated waste, recycled waste and the number of composting plants created.
 Indicators on resources and materials represent 9% of the framework, measuring material flows (exports and imports), the self-sufficiency of materials and the recovery of materials. These indicators are prevalently included in the environmental category (78%).
 A total of 8% of the sample refer to repair, reuse and share, which mainly covers the categories of infrastructure and technology (35%), environment (28%) and governance (20%). This sector includes indicators on impacts and results from the reuse and repair of several objects and materials (e.g. objects redirected/repaired from recycling centres; the number of goods reused internally in the local administration; and the ratio of products repaired to new products sold). Additionally, it addresses the infrastructure that promotes and enables repair and reuse. Examples of the latter are: the number of reuse centres in the city; the number of recycling centres organised; and collaborative spaces equipped with materials and equipment to encourage repair. Other indicators cover the governance approach of the sector, including indicators such as the number

of meetings of a working group to boost sharing or the number of projects realised for the sharing
economy.
 A total of 7% of indicators are devoted to the built environment, of which 44% belongs to the governance category (Figure 3Figure 3. ). Indicators cover the whole life cycle of buildings, from the design (e.g. construction works with circular design and projects incorporating smart design) to end of life (e.g. recovery rate of construction and demolition waste). Other indicators refer to the use and consumption of materials (e.g. construction and demolition waste usage rate, the recovery rate of construction and demolition waste, the recovery rate of construction waste as material). Several indicators also address the existence of circular-economy-related certifications for buildings (e.g. number of companies with certification based on life cycle or eco-design, percentage of construction projects applying to certification programmes and the inclusion of eco-designed products).
 There is a small number of energy-related indicators (7%), most of them classified in the environmental category (85%). The existing indicators mostly relate to energy consumption levels (e.g. biofuel consumption; energy efficiency in buildings and homes; and electrical energy consumption), energy recovery (e.g. percentage of used lubricant oils collected and treated for energy recovery) and energy valorisation (e.g. the number of projects implemented for the valorisation of energy).
 Food (7%) is another relevant sector for measuring circularity, especially in terms of waste: the amount of food waste generated, the number of food recovery-redistribution actions and food waste avoided through a circular consumption.
 Water-related indicators (3%) mainly focus on water regeneration and wastewater, mainly belonging to the environmental category (46%). Some examples from the inventory are: regenerated water used as a source of water supply; the percentage of urban wastewater treated/total wastewater generated; and the number of approved water reuse projects per year.
 Few measurement frameworks have started to monitor the role of the public administration as a driver for the circular economy (3%). Governance is the primary category within this sector (58%). Some examples of the indicators are: the number of municipal staff trained on the circular economy; the economic savings from the reuse of furniture and equipment of the local administration; and the number of municipal staff actively working on the development of a circular vision.
 Indicators related to the sub-category air (2%) refers to emissions of CO2 and GHG, and are all included in the environmental category (100%). However, according to the OECD survey, cities and regions tend to have difficulties in the collection of reliable data for measuring emissions.
 Other sectors (6%): this group encompasses the sectors with few additional indicators (with representation equal or below 1% of the OECD inventory) and includes the following sectors, ordered by their share in the inventory: land use (e.g. new districts incorporating the principles of the circular economy); textile (e.g. clothing recycled per year and savings made by not replacing items of clothing); culture (e.g. collected materials and objects in pilot projects within cultural facilities and Identification of pilot operations in the cultural sector); industry (e.g. working group meetings with major industry players for better regulatory alignment as a boost to the circular economy); agriculture (seed banks and agro-ecological initiatives); mobility (car sharing and use of private vehicles in cities); forestry (direct jobs associated with the forest/wood sector); and tourism (number of tourism enterprises and productivity of the sustainable tourism sector).
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the sectors across the categories. Energy (85%), resources and materials (78%) and waste (71%) are predominantly included in the “environment” category. Indicators not sector- specific (62%), public administration (58%) and built environment (44%) belongs to the “governance” category. Regarding the category “infrastructure and technology”, indicators refer to reuse, repair and

share (35%), food (19%) and built environment (12%). Finally, the “job” category is composed of indicators referring to not sector-specific (12%), public administration (8%) and repair, reuse and share (8%) indicators.

Environmental-related indicators
According to the sample collected within the OECD Inventory of Circular Economy Indicators, environmental indicators prevail (39%) (Table 2). Environmental indicators have been divided into sub- categories, following the categorisation applied by the European Commission (EC) (2018[3]) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) (2016[4]) as much as possible:
 Output material process indicators prevail (36% of all the environmental indicators). This sub-category includes indicators measuring the various phases of waste and material that can be reused and transformed into resources (e.g. material collected for the reuse of building materials and collection of plastics; objects recovered in reuse centres and materials and waste recovered).
 Production and consumption (27%) cover materials and resources that have been used in the economy, mostly in the generation of waste measured in several sectors (e.g. construction waste, food waste, waste generation from commerce and industry, municipal waste). The consumption of resources is also included within this sub-category: energy consumption, domestic material consumption, consumption of virgin materials and water consumption.
 The sub-category of use (14%) describes those indicators on the utilisation and reuse of resources (e.g. amount of resources used and put back into the system; direct resource use; and direct land use), as well as several use rates (e.g. circular material use rate and reuse of packaging waste).
 Savings (12%) refers to indicators mentioning the consumption avoidance and savings of different resources such as energy, food, raw materials and clothing (e.g. food waste avoided through a circular consumption and energy saved by energy efficiency programmes).
 Emissions indicators (9%), mainly measure the generation of greenhouse gases including CO2 emissions from different activities. In some cases, these indicators concern the circular economy

in a broad sense and do not refer to specific sectors (e.g. CO2 emissions per capita), while other indicators are associated to specific activities and areas (e.g. emissions related with the consumption of materials; CO2 savings as a result of procurement activities the carbon impact of waste generation).
 Other indicators from this category analyse efficiency (2%), which measures the achievement of the maximum output from a given level of resources used to carry out an activity (OECD, 2013[5]). Efficiency-related indicators in the sample focus on the energy sector (e.g. energy efficiency, energy intensity and energy efficiency in buildings and homes).

          Governance related indicators
Governance indicators represent approximately one-third of the sample, with the sub-categories of awareness-raising, as well as innovation, pilots and experiments being those with the highest representation (14% each) (Table 3):
 Awareness-raising indicators mainly refer to the number of awareness-raising campaigns and events organised for different areas (e.g. food waste reduction, plastic use reduction and water reuse). However, indicators account also for other ways of raising awareness and disseminating circular economy principles in the format of workshops, events, publications, guidelines and platforms.
THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN CITIES AND REGIONS: SYNTHESIS REPORT © OECD 2020

24 
 Regarding innovation, pilots and experiments, these indicators primarily include indicators related to the implementation of research and development (R&D) pilots and projects: e.g. the creation of an innovation platform for the circular economy, the number of experimental and pilot projects, the number of circular-economy-related R&D projects and the number of actors involved in experimental projects.
 Strategy and initiatives (12%) indicators generally monitor the number of initiatives adopted (e.g. agro-ecological initiatives, projects incorporating smart design, green and circular initiatives and number of water reuse projects). Furthermore, they analyse the different circular initiatives adopted by local authorities, as well as the steps for their adoption, the level of implementation and the number of documents created.
 Public procurement (11%): This category includes indicators linked to the inclusion of circular and green criteria in the purchasing of goods, services and works by governments. Several indicators account for the volume of public procurement that includes circular and/or ecological criteria (measured as a percentage of total procurement, number of tenders or total amount in euros). Other indicators address the number of identified legal barriers for the implementation of green public procurement (GPP), or the number of companies informed about circular-economy- related public procurement opportunities.
 Capacity building (9%) indicators address the number of training courses on the circular economy, and the different activities to build knowledge of the circular economy. Indicators distinguish the training courses aimed at municipal staff (e.g. city staff trained in circular economy and circular procurement principles; and the number of training modules created for municipal staff). Other examples of this sub-category are: training courses and their level of implementation in the circular economy, conferences and seminars for improving skills, support programmes and guides.
 Regulation (9%): Indicators within this category focus on the creation and update of the existing regulation to boost the circular economy and the identification and removal of identified regulatory barriers. Indicators not only focus on the results and achievements (e.g. new laws and updates to boost the circular economy; removed regulatory barriers the number of legislative obstacles identified and resolved laws and regulation for the adaptation of the private sector to the circular economy) but also on the entire process (e.g. number of working group meetings to work on better legislation and the number of circular policy advisers developing circular regulations).
 Education (8%) indicators measure to what extend the circular economy is included in educational policies and curriculum. Examples of this sub-sector are: the number of students trained in the circular economy fields of activity; mainstreaming education for sustainable development into regional education policies; and the number of schools and universities that responded to the call for projects on circular economy education.
 Stakeholder engagement (8%) indicators mainly focus on actions to engage with key actors involved in all phases of the circular economy initiative (design, implementation and monitoring). Some examples include: the number of the circular economy vision-forming meetings, the number of actors mobilised, the number of collaborative projects implemented by circular economy networks and the number of meetings for circular projects.
 The inventory also collects indicators on collaboration (6%) activities, involving all actions related to co-operation among different actors (e.g. institutions) for synergies, projects and workshops to boost a circular economy. Indicators measure the way collaboration frameworks are built, by monitoring the number of meetings of working groups to boost the circular economy. Other indicators aim to measure the implementation of the collaboration frameworks such as the number of collaborative projects implemented, or the implementation of identified synergies.
THE OECD INVENTORY OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY INDICATORS© OECD 2021

 Few indicators deal with the monitoring and evaluation (5%) of circular economy initiatives and actions (e.g. follow-up and monitoring of the results of circular economy programmes and studies of the establishment of charges and life-cycle and cost-benefit studies).
 Financing (4%) indicators refer to all the economic support provided by governments to conduct a circular initiative (e.g. financial resources mobilised for experiments, the budget amount assigned to calls for projects and budget of pilot public contracts in the circular economy).

     Economy and business indicators
Economy and business indicators specifically tailored to the circular economy represent 14% of the share and include 8 specific sub-indicators (Table 4):
 The sub-category of business (30%) encompasses those indicators that specifically refer to the performance of companies and the introduction of business models such as new revenue models related to the circular economy and the number of companies implementing product-as-a-service business models.
 The sub-category indicator of investments (16%) covers the public and private investment in R&D, goods and projects related to the circular economy. Some examples include: public expenditure on R&D related to the circular economy and the amount invested in circular economy projects.
 Savings (12%) measures all financial resources saved in certain circular actions (e.g. money saved, in comparison with purchasing new) through the reuse of building materials; reduced costs through the implementation of green procurement; and the economic savings due to the reuse of furniture of the local administration and waste reduction.
 Productivity (12%) measures the amount of economic output generated per unit of material.
 Added value (11%) incorporates indicators related to the value generation created by the circular economy and circular activities (e.g. the economic value of the resources used and gross value added [GVA] generated).
 Economic efficiency (8%) includes materials and energy intensity, measured in monetary terms.
 Gains and revenues (6%) measure revenues obtained through performing actions closely related to the circular economy (e.g. turnover on circular products and economic gains of the reduction of the digital impact in the public administration).

 Economic structure (5%) includes indicators such as the weight of the green economy in gross
domestic product (GDP) and GDP per total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

           Infrastructure and technology indicators
Infrastructure and technology indicators correspond to 8% of the inventory (Table 5). Facilities (61%) includes all indicators linked to centres mainly dedicated to reuse, repair and share activities. Some examples include: the number of reuse centres in the city; the number of repair cafés; the number of donation and sharing spaces; and the number of repair and reuse centres created. The area sub-category (18%) aims to measure the space within cities that have adopted any kind of circular initiative or criteria. Examples include the share of the city covered by experimental areas, the districts incorporating circular economy principles and the public space recovered for sustainable models. The primary measurement unit for this sub-category is the share of space in terms of total local space. Equipment (13%) covers all the devices and bins installed in cities for sustainable waste management (e.g. number of bins allocated, water dispensers installed in the city and waste collection devices). Finally, the remaining indicators address products and services (8%) (e.g. new circular products and share of circular products in the total number).

           Societal indicators
Indicators related to jobs represent 5% of the sample (Table 6). These indicators mainly relate to employment and human resources. Indicators distinguish between employment within circular economy generic activities and job creation in specific circular economy sectors such as the sharing economy, the reuse and repair sector and the forestry sector. Most indicators specifically relate to jobs and some examples include: the number of green jobs created and secured, the net circular job growth, and the number of jobseekers having been employed as a result of circular economy training. A few indicators also refer to human resources: human resources mobilised for experiments in the building sector; the number of people actively working on the development of a circular vision; and the number of local co-ordinators recruited for the development of territorial synergies.
